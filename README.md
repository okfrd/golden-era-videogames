\
This project analyzes video game critic and user scores to identify:\
1. The top 10 best-selling games.\
2. The 10 years with the highest average critic scores (with at least 4 games released).\
3. The "golden years" where critics and users broadly agreed on high ratings.\
\
## Data\

- `game_sales`: Contains sales data for the top 400 video games since 1977.\
- `users_avg_year_rating` and `critics_avg_year_rating`: Provide average user and critic scores per year.\
